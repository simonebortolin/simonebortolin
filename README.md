### Hi, I'm Simone ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a BSc computer engineering student. Right now I'm a freelance and junior full stack developer.
I'm passionate about all computer science: from hardware to software, yes on my GitHub you can find little stuff, I have some OSS projects on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/simonebortolin)
I would like to release other open source projects and materials, including school notes and summaries.
